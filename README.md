# Image Predictor Using CNNs and CIFAR10 Dataset

## *How to Run*

- Install dependencies `pip install tensorflow numpy pillow flask scikit-learn matplotlib`.
- `my_model.keras` has already been trained on the required data. Clone the repo to your local desktop and run `app.py`.
- Open the local server address in your browser `127.0.0.1:5000`. 
- Upload Images and press `Predict` to see the results.

You can modify and run `main.ipynb` to train the model with your own parameters.
